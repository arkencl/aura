#  Aura - Discord Karma Bot

Aura is a discord bot focused on rewarding user contributions through
an arbitrary point system called karma. It has the following features:

* Give out karma on messages containing a custom list of case-insensitive keywords.
    * Cooldowns are applied one-way to each pair of thankee-giver, that means that the giver-thankee can
    swap while the cooldown of thankee-giver is still ticking.
    * Ignores invalid mentions like: self author mentions, bot mentions, bot thanking other users.
    * Ignores messages containing discord greentext, keywords enclosed in quatation marks.
* Configurable Feedback on karma gain
    * Logging to a channel.
    * Thumbs up reaction to the message.
    * Affirmation Message in same channel as the thank you message.
    * or all of the above.
* Blacklist and Whitelist Members from giving out karma.
    * Blacklisted Members on trying to give karma will get a DM specifying who to contact to dispute it.
* Get Karma of one or multiple Members through Mentions, or user id's.
    * self karma requires no arguments.
* Karma Profile with the Discord Profile Picture, full name (name + discriminator) or nick,
total karma and karma breakdown by top x channels configured.
    * single mention only.
    * self profile requires no arguments.
* Karma Leaderboard globally or per channel
 * provide optional argument of days to get a time restricted leaderboard
* Reset all Karma of a Member in a guild, this currently has no undo functionality.
* Delete karma from Members on message delete, reaction clear and reaction removal.
* Change most configuration on the fly by providing keys from the config.yaml.
* Module Model, enable and disable features you don't need or like.
* Karma Help Commands to provide you with all the information on aura and how it works,
what configuration parameters mean etc.
* Change Permission of every command but the help command, disable the help module if you don't need it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This Bot requires a privileged intent: members.
This Bot requires a mongodb database

To run this bot you need to manually fill out the following values in the config.yaml.example
or create config.yaml with the following fields filled out.

    admin: "<Exact Name of Admin role>"
owner: <id of bot-owner>
everything under the database key
```

Every other value can be updated by executing \<prefix>
config \<key> or config \<key> \<key> etc. for the
according key in the config yaml with a user that has the configured admin role.
